# angular-seed-coffee

This is [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) port of the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project. CoffeeScripts are built into JS using Grunt so make sure to install npm dependencies if you don't have them already.

### Differencies
- Application is now bootstrapped manually in app.coffee file

### TODOs
- Port tests as well
